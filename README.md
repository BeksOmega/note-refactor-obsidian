# note-refactor-obsidian

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for extracting the selected portion of a notes into new note. 

The defaults hotkey is:

| Hotkey                                            | Action                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>                    | Copy selection into new note and replace with a link.                 |

The new file is created at the root of the vault.

Headings `#` and other illegal characters for filenames are removed including `:`, `\`, `/`.

A check is done to avoid overwriting of existing files but...

    ðŸ’¥ PLEASE TRY IN A TEST VAULT FIRST! ðŸ’¥
