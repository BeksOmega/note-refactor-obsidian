# note-refactor-obsidian

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for extracting the selected portion of a notes into new note. 

Credit to [MrJackphil](https://github.com/mrjackphil), this plugin is based on [the code snippet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/code-snippet-extract-note/6698) he created.

The default hotkey is:

| Hotkey                                            | Action                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>                    | Copy selection into new note and replace with a link.                 |

The new note file is created at the root of the vault with the filename as the first line of the selected text and the content as the rest of the selected text.

Headings (`#`) characters and other illegal characters for filenames are removed including `:`, `\`, `/`.
