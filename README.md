# Note Refactor

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for extracting the selected portion of a notes into new note. 

Credit to [MrJackphil](https://github.com/mrjackphil), this plugin is based on [the code snippet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/code-snippet-extract-note/6698) he created.

The default hotkey is:

| Hotkey                                                                   | Action                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>                    | **Extract selection to new note - first line as filename:** Copy selection into new note with the first line as the file name and replace with a link.                 |
| <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>                    | **Extract selection to new note - content only:** Copy selection into new note, prompt for a file name and replace with a link.                 |

    
>:warning: Hotkey defaults are deliberately not set for note splitting commands to avoid unwanted accidents.

The new note file is created at the root of the vault with the filename as the first line of the selected text and the content as the rest of the selected text.

Headings (`#`) characters and other illegal characters for filenames are removed including `:`, `\`, `/`.

![plugin settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian/master/images/plugin-settings.png)

### Default location for new notes
The location for new notes to be saved as a plugin config setting in line with the Obsidian core `Default location for new notes` setting. 

3 options available:

1. Vault folder
1. Same folder as current file
1. Specified folder

The specified folder option allows you to specify a folder path for new notes which can include multiple datetime formats.

An example:
A folder path set as `Zettels/{{date:YYYY}}/{{date:MMMM}}` will add a new file to the following folder structure:

- [Vault]
  - Zettels
    - 2020
      - October

### First Line included as Note Heading
A config setting allows for the first line of the selected text to be included in the new note content as a heading with a configurable heading format `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.

This setting is applied for either the First Line filename or Content Only commands.
