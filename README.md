# note-refactor-obsidian

This repository contains a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for extracting the selected portion of a notes into new note. 

Credit to [MrJackphil](https://github.com/mrjackphil), this plugin is based on [the code snippet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/code-snippet-extract-note/6698) he created.

The default hotkey is:

| Hotkey                                            | Action                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>                    | Copy selection into new note and replace with a link.                 |

The new file is created at the root of the vault.

Headings `#` and other illegal characters for filenames are removed including `:`, `\`, `/`.

A check is done to avoid overwriting of existing files but...
